# Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### Technical Accuracy and Academic Rigor
All technical definitions and concepts must be cross-checked with credible robotics/AI literature (IEEE, ACM, Springer, MIT Press). Content must be technically accurate and rooted in current robotics, AI, and mechatronics research.

### Clarity and Accessibility
Content must be clear and accessible for undergraduate and early-graduate learners. Complex concepts should be explained with practical examples, diagrams, and visual aids. Avoid overuse of advanced jargon unless defined clearly inside the text.

### Practical Applicability (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Every theoretical concept must be paired with practical applicability through examples, diagrams, and hands-on exercises. All code snippets (Python, ROS, etc.) must be runnable and verified, and all mathematical formulas must be validated and tested for correctness.

### Conceptual Integrity
Physical AI must be explained as embodied intelligence, not merely software-based AI. Maintain consistency across chapters in terminology, tone, and structure with clear, consistent terminology for humanoid robotics, control systems, sensors, and Physical AI frameworks.

### Educational Structure
Each chapter must start with learning objectives and end with summary plus exercises. The textbook must maintain consistent structure: 10–14 chapters + glossary + index, with each chapter deliverable as an independent learning module.

### Visual and Interactive Learning
Visual explanations (diagrams, flowcharts, pseudocode) are required where beneficial. All content must be formatted as Docusaurus-compatible Markdown files and fully buildable using Spec-Kit Plus and deployable on GitHub Pages.

## Additional Constraints
Technology stack: Docusaurus-compatible Markdown files
Length: ~40,000 to 60,000 words total
Format: Must be fully buildable using Spec-Kit Plus and deployable on GitHub Pages
Citation format: IEEE Style
Academic rigor: 40% of sources must be peer-reviewed research papers or academic books
Content scope: Must cover Foundations of Physical AI & embodied intelligence, Humanoid robot anatomy, Sensors/actuators/locomotion, Control theory, Perception/motion planning, HRI principles, Safety/ethics, Practical labs, and Emerging trends

## Development Workflow
Content development must follow the spec-plan-tasks workflow with formal review by subject matter experts. Each chapter must undergo peer review to ensure technical accuracy. All code examples and mathematical formulas must be validated through testing. Success criteria include: book compiles without errors in Docusaurus, content is technically accurate and up-to-date, all chapters maintain consistent structure and writing style, students can follow concepts without prior deep robotics knowledge, hands-on activities are testable and produce expected outputs, peer reviewers find no major conceptual errors.

## Governance
This constitution governs all aspects of the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics textbook development. All content, code, and documentation must comply with these principles. Any deviations must be documented and justified. The constitution supersedes all other practices and guides all decision-making for the project. All reviews must verify compliance with these principles.
