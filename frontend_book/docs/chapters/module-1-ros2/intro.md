# Introduction to Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

This module introduces the foundational middleware layer of humanoid robotics, explaining ROS 2 as the "robotic nervous system" enabling communication, control, and coordination.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:
1. Understand the core architecture of ROS 2 including nodes, topics, services, and actions
2. Develop basic ROS 2 nodes in Python using rclpy
3. Model humanoid robots using URDF for simulation and control

## Module Structure

This module consists of three chapters:

1. **Chapter 1**: Introduction to ROS 2 Architecture
   - Nodes, topics, services, actions
   - DDS-based communication
   - ROS 2 vs ROS 1 (conceptual comparison)

2. **Chapter 2**: ROS 2 Development with Python (rclpy)
   - Writing ROS 2 nodes in Python
   - Publishers, subscribers, services
   - Bridging Python AI agents to ROS controllers
   - Best practices for modular robot software

3. **Chapter 3**: Robot Modeling with URDF for Humanoids
   - URDF structure and syntax
   - Links, joints, transmissions
   - Modeling humanoid robots
   - Preparing URDFs for simulation and control

## Prerequisites

Students should have basic Python knowledge before starting this module.
