# Introduction to Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

This module introduces the concept of digital twins in robotics, focusing on simulation environments that enable safe experimentation, rapid iteration, and scalable AI training for humanoid robots. You'll learn how physics-based simulation tools like Gazebo and Unity serve as the bridge between ROS 2 control systems (covered in Module 1) and AI training pipelines (covered in Module 3).

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:
1. Understand the concept of digital twins and their role in robotics development
2. Implement physics simulations using Gazebo for humanoid robots
3. Simulate various sensors (LiDAR, cameras, IMUs) with realistic noise models
4. Integrate simulation environments with ROS 2 control systems
5. Prepare simulated data for AI training pipelines

## Module Structure

This module consists of three chapters:

1. **Chapter 1**: Introduction to Digital Twins in Robotics

   - Role of simulation in humanoid robotics
   - Gazebo vs Unity: strengths and use cases

2. **Chapter 2**: Physics Simulation with Gazebo
   - Physics engines and fundamental concepts
   - World files and environment modeling
   - Gazebo-ROS 2 integration

3. **Chapter 3**: Sensor Simulation and Human–Robot Interaction
   - Sensor simulation techniques and noise modeling
   - Unity for high-fidelity rendering and HRI
   - Conceptual pipeline to AI training

## Prerequisites

Students should have completed Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) or have equivalent knowledge of:
- ROS 2 architecture (nodes, topics, services, actions)
