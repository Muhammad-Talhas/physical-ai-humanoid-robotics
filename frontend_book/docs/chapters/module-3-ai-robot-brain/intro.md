# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module introduces advanced perception, navigation, and learning pipelines that act as the "brain" of a humanoid robot using NVIDIA Isaac technologies.

## Overview

In this module, you will learn how NVIDIA Isaac bridges simulation, AI training, and deployment, positioning it as the transition from **simulation environments (Module 2)** to **intelligent autonomous behavior (Module 4)**.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
1. Understand NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic robotics simulation
2. Implement GPU-accelerated perception pipelines using Isaac ROS
3. Apply Visual SLAM (VSLAM) for mapping and localization
4. Configure autonomous navigation systems using Nav2
5. Generate synthetic data for AI training
6. Integrate perception and navigation for intelligent behavior

## Module Structure

- Chapter 1: NVIDIA Isaac Sim & Synthetic Data Generation
- Chapter 2: Isaac ROS & Visual SLAM
- Chapter 3: Autonomous Navigation with Nav2

## Prerequisites

This module assumes you have completed:
- Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

You should be comfortable with ROS 2 concepts and simulation environments before proceeding.
