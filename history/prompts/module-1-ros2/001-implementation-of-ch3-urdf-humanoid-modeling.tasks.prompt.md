## Prompt

Complete the implementation of Module 1 Chapter 3 on URDF for humanoid modeling, including creating the content file, URDF example, diagrams, and updating the tasks file to mark all User Story 3 tasks as completed.

## Response snapshot

Successfully implemented Chapter 3 of the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics textbook on URDF for humanoid modeling. Created:
- Complete chapter content file (ch3-urdf-humanoid-modeling.md) with learning objectives, URDF structure, links/joints, transmissions, humanoid modeling, simulation preparation, summary, exercises, and references
- URDF example file (simple_humanoid.urdf) demonstrating a complete humanoid robot model
- Two SVG diagrams: URDF structure example and humanoid model diagram
- Updated tasks.md file to mark all User Story 3 tasks as completed [x]

The chapter covers essential URDF concepts including XML structure, links and joints, transmissions, and best practices for humanoid robot modeling. The content includes practical code examples for URDF files and ROS 2 launch files for visualization.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete implementation of Module 1 Chapter 3 on URDF for humanoid modeling
- 🧪 Tests: No specific tests created
- 📁 Files: 5 files created/updated including chapter content, URDF example, 2 diagrams, and tasks file
- 🔁 Next prompts: Module implementation complete
- 🧠 Reflection: Implementation followed the task structure precisely and created comprehensive educational content for humanoid robot modeling with URDF

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
